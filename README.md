Problem Statement: Digitalization of the Hospitality Process
Objective: Develop a web application to facilitate digitalizing the hospitality process for group
accommodation. The application should allow users to upload two CSV files to efficiently
allocate rooms in hostels while ensuring group members with the same ID stay together and
adhere to hostel capacities and gender-specific accommodations.
